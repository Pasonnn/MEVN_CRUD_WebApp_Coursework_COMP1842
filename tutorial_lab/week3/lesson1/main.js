        description: "Socks are a type of soft, often knitted, garment worn on the feet for comfort, warmth, and protection. They help absorb sweat, provide cushioning, and prevent friction between the foot and footwear, reducing the risk of blisters. Available in various materials such as cotton, wool, synthetic fibers, and blends, socks come in a wide range of styles, colors, and lengths, from ankle socks to knee-highs. They are essential for daily wear, sports, and special occasions, enhancing foot hygiene and overall comfort."
