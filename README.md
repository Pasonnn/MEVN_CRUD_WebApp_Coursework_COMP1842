# MEVN CRUD Web Application - COMP1842 Coursework

This repository contains the coursework project for the COMP1842 Web Programming 2 module. The primary goal of this project is to develop a CRUD web application using the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js), showcasing both technical skills and an understanding of modern JavaScript and database technologies.

## Project Overview

The project is structured in three main parts:

1. **Weekly Lab Tasks**: Practical lab assignments completed over six weeks, demonstrating foundational skills and documented in the appendices.
2. **MEVN CRUD System Development**: Implementation of a basic CRUD system on the MEVN stack, including:
   - A test page to verify system functionality
   - An additional menu item and page
   - Adding a third field to the existing system to extend functionality
3. **Analytical Report**: A written report (1500-2000 words) analyzing:
   - Differences between RDBMS and NoSQL databases
   - Comparison of MEVN and XAMPP stacks
   - Benefits of Vue.js for modern web development

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for managing application data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework to handle server logic.
- **Vue.js**: Frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side scripting.

## Learning Outcomes

- Develop a fully functional CRUD web application with the MEVN stack.
- Understand and analyze the distinctions between SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Evaluate the differences between modern JavaScript stacks (MEVN) and traditional XAMPP stack development.
- Gain insights into the technical and legal considerations of web technologies, including accessibility and security.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the frontend code for the Vue.js application.
- `server/`: Contains the backend code using Node.js and Express.js.
- `report/`: The final report in PDF format, analyzing databases, stack comparisons, and relevant technologies.
- `appendices/`: Documentation and evidence of completed lab tasks.
